# ✅ **🔥 Deep Learning – Trend Analysis (Most Frequently Asked Topics)**

Based on all the question papers provided, these are the **topics that appear again and again**, either in Part-A 2-mark or Part-B 10-mark questions.

---

# ⭐ **1. Linear Algebra (ALWAYS ASKED)**

Appears in almost every paper (2 marks or 10 marks).
Most repeated subtopics:

* Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors
* Eigen Decomposition
* Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
* PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
* Norms
* Matrices vs Tensors

**High priority — confirmed trend**
Because every paper has at least 2–3 questions from this area.

---

# ⭐ **2. Fundamental ML Concepts (Very Frequent)**

These appear consistently:

* Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
* Bias–Variance
* Underfitting & Overfitting
* Maximum Likelihood vs Bayesian Statistics
* Role of Hidden Units
* Validation Sets
* Hyperparameter Tuning

**This is one of the easiest scoring areas.**

---

# ⭐ **3. Gradient Descent & Optimization (Every paper includes)**

Highly repeated topics:

* Gradient Descent (mathematics + explanation)
* Gradient-Based Optimization
* Different Optimizers (Momentum, RMSProp, Adam)
* Parameter Initialization & its effects
* Challenges in Neural Network Optimization

**Expected every year — top trend.**

---

# ⭐ **4. Feedforward Neural Networks (Frequently Asked)**

Repeated questions on:

* Deep Feedforward Network Architecture
* XOR problem explanation
* Backpropagation (working + math + steps)
* Depth & Width effects

**Backprop & XOR are very common — must prepare.**

---

# ⭐ **5. Regularization Techniques (Often repeated)**

Most frequent topics:

* L1, L2 Regularization
* Dataset Augmentation
* Bagging & Boosting (Ensemble Methods)
* Dropout
* Parameter Tying & Sharing
* Multi-Task Learning

**This entire chapter is heavily asked.**

---

# ⭐ **6. Convolutional Neural Networks (Most repeated area in Part-B)**

This is **the MOST IMPORTANT Unit**.

Repeated topics:

* Convolution Operation
* Components of CNN (Convolution, Pooling, Fully Connected)
* Kernel size, stride, padding
* Variants of CNN
* Tiled Convolution
* Efficient Convolution Algorithms
* Data Types for CNN
* Applications of CNN

**Expect at least 1 Part-B question every exam.**

---

# ⭐ **7. RNNs & Sequence Models (Frequently repeated)**

This also appears in every single paper.

Trending topics:

* Basic RNNs
* LSTM (block diagram often asked)
* GRU / Gated RNNs
* Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
* Encoder–Decoder (Seq2Seq)
* Bidirectional RNNs
* Long-term dependency optimization

**RNN architecture questions are nearly guaranteed.**

---

# ⭐ **8. Advanced Concepts (Occasionally repeated but important)**

Still appear in multiple papers:

* Adversarial Training
* Adversarial Attacks
* Tangent Classifier
* Recursive Neural Networks
* Autoencoders (basic + applications + sequence use)

**These appear less frequently, but enough to be exam-relevant.**
